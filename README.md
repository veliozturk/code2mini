<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">An opinionated low code platform that helps you code business applications in a better way</p>

<hr />

## The problem
There are certain parts of a business application that developers build from scratch again and again everytime they build a business application. And these parts take the most time to finish. We need to stop reinventing the wheel. 

## This solution
iCodeBetter is way powerful than existing low-code platforms. And unlike others it's online and open source.
